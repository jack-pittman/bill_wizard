Welcome to Bill Wrangler! <br><br>

Using AWS Cost Explorer, it is possible to download custom billing reports as .csv files. <br><br>

This tool aims to make the process of analyzing and 'exploring' these files more convenient. <br><br>

Simply upload each file, grouping by the desired dimension, and this tool will generate graphs and download-able tables! <br><br>

Happy Wrangling!
